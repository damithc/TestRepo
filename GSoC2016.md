####Short Description: 
TEAMMATES is an award winning online feedback management system for education. 
It is a Java EE app hosted on the App Engine, used by 75K+ users from 300+ universities.

####Long Description

TEAMMATES is an award winning online feedback management system for teachers/students. 
It is a free Java EE SaaS application that runs on the Google App Engine. 
It is currently used by more than 75K users from 300+ universities. 
It is a not-for-profit project funded by education grants.

TEAMMATES won the grand prize OSS World Challenge 2014 and took part in GSoCs 2014 and 2015 as a mentoring organization.
The long-term vision of TEAMMATES is to become the biggest student-built project in the world. 
So far,  it has received contributions of 130+ student developers and have done more than 200 releases over a five year period. 
Because one of the main aims of TEAMMATES (the project)  is to train students in contributing to non-trivial OSS productions system, 
it is well-designed, well-documented, and well-tested (we have a very high level of automated testing).
The product uses several emerging technologies (e.g., Google App Engine) learning of which will benefit students. 
Because TEAMMATES (the product) is a software *for* students *by* students, students can relate to the problem domain better. 
The scale of the system is big enough (~300 KLoC) without being overwhelmingly big. 

Project led by faculty member [Damith C. Rajapakse](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~damithch)  and his team.

##Why does your org want to participate in Google Summer of Code?
TEAMMATES the product is a software *for* students *by* students. TEAMMATES the project aims to train a large number of students on developing production quality software with real users, in particular, using the OSS model. Within the short time of four years, we have been able to increase our developer base to 130+ and user base to 300+ universities.  Our previous GSoC stints (2014 : 4 students, 2015 : 6 students) were great successes, all 10 students completing their projects at a level beyond expectations and all 10 continued to contribute to the project after GSoC. 

#####Here are some reasons why TEAMMATES is a good match for GSoC:

* **Low learning curve due to relatable domain**: 
The domain i.e., peer evaluation/feedback, is easy to understand and students can relate to it naturally.

* **Mature**: 13000+ commits, 4000+ issues/PRs, [200+ releases](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/milestones?direction=desc&sort=due_date&state=closed), In operation since 2010 

* **Not too big, not too small**:
The code base, which is currently about 300 KLoC, is not too small to be trivial but not too big to be overwhelming for students. Since the product was built primarily by undergraduate students, it does not contain anything that is ‘over the head’ of GSoC participants.
Our user bases is just the right size. It is not too big so that we can support it without overstretching our resources (all our developers are full time students). However, it is big enough and diverse enough (spanning 75k users from 300+ universities) to represent a ‘real’ product.

* **Ideal for training students**: 
Since the main aim of TEAMMATES (the project)  is to train students, it is designed to be a model system for students to learn engineering non-trivial cloud apps. It is well-designed, well-documented, and well-tested (we have a very high level of automated testing).The product is using cutting edge technologies (e.g., Google App Engine) learning of which will benefit students. 

* **Ready for newbie student developers**: 
New contributor onboarding process have been stress-tested for new student contributors. We have a contributor orientation guide (http://tinyurl.com/teammates-orientation )  and other learning resources to help new developers. This also means we are experienced in mentoring students. Our dev ops too are [well documented](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/blob/master/devdocs/process.md) and have been stress-tested for student developers. At times we have had 30+ new student developers contributing production code and taking part in our weekly release cycles.

* **We use Google stuff**: 
TEAMMATES tools stack is primarily Google technologies such as Google App Engine, Google Docs, and Google groups.

* **We have a long history with GSoC**:
Damith (main admin): Was the academic advisor for GSoC participants from NUS since 2009. Under his ‘GSoC drive’, NUS participation increased from ‘non-existent’ in 2008 to ‘top 10’ in 2010-2011 and ‘top 3’ in 2012. Here are some of Damith’s posters used to promote GSoC in NUS: [2012](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~seer/NUS-GSoC-2012-Poster.png) [2011](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~seer/NUS-GSoC-2011-Poster.png) [2010](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~seer/NUS-GSoC-2010-Poster.png) [2009](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~seer/NUS-GSoC-2009-Poster.png)

TEAMMATES took part in GSoC 2014 and 2015 as an MO.

#####Here are some of the negative points about TEAMMATES

* Moderate activity on the mailing list: This is because most of our discussions are done on our issue tracker. Furthermore, most of our current students are from our university and they sometimes use our own LMS to communicate among each other.
* The academic nature of the project: While the project lives in an academic setting, the very purpose of it is to give students a taste of ‘real’ software engineering as opposed to what is taught in normal college SE courses.

##How many potential mentors have agreed to mentor this year?
15 (list given [here](http://tinyurl.com/teammates-gsoc))
Most mentors have had past GSoC experience as a student or a mentor and many have mentoring experience outside GSoC as well. Project admin and main mentor Damith has mentored 130+ student contributors in TEAMMATES project. He has taught software engineering to more than 2000 students at various levels.

##How will you keep mentors engaged with their students?

* Students are expected to make daily commits and all PRs will be reviewed by the mentor. Therefore, mentor-student interactions happen every working day.
*Each project has two mentors, in case one is not available.  Both admin and back up admin are experienced in mentoring large number of students at a time and are competent enough to mentor any of the proposed projects. In the worst case, any one of us can take over the mentoring of all GSoC participants given to us. Both of us work for the university and are free (no teaching duties) during summer holidays.


##How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects?
*Detect: TEAMMATES follows a very agile approach. We break work into small tasks that can be done within a day. We push code everyday, and we release a new version every week. We expect new contributors to fall into this pattern too. Due to this approach, we can detect those falling behind fairly quickly. 

*Clear expectations: We have made [our expectations](http://tinyurl.com/teammates-gsoc) clear to potential applicants. We treat GSoC participants as full time project members and expect them to work full time for the full duration of the coding phase. ‘disappearing’ is out of the question. 

##How will you get your students involved in your community during GSoC?
*Before : Our GSoC applicants are encouraged to complete an ‘orientation task list’ before they apply. 
*During : We expect students to push code almost everyday. All code pushed will be reviewed by a senior developer. This process guarantee enough interaction during the coding phase.
* After: We plan to use most of the student work in the production system. (This sounds too ambitious, but remember, our entire system was built by students. We have a good code quality assurance process to ensure students produce production quality code.) This means it is inevitable that we will continue to touch base with past contributors regarding their past work, after GSoC. 
* Any time: We have a 24 hour response guarantee for our mailing list, including weekends. 


##How will you keep students involved with your community after GSoC?
As stated in our [instructions to potential applicants](http://tinyurl.com/teammates-gsoc), those who continue to contribute after GSoC can rise through the [core member ranks](https://teammatesv4.appspot.com/about.html ) and will be given priority for future GSoCs. All students who worked for TEAMMATES under GSoC 2014 and 2015 went on to become core developers.

##Has your org been accepted as a mentoring org in Google Summer of Code before?
Yes, 2014 (4 students) and 2015 (6 students). All 10 passed and all 10 continued to contribute after GSoC.

##Are you part of a foundation/umbrella organization?
No

##What year was your project started?
2010
